              <h5 class="card-title">Mom</h5>
              <p class="card-text">My mom is a 7th grade English teacher in Urbana and she is the kindest person in the world, but I am biased so maybe she isn't the kindest. She is a great teacher, but she also possesses mad cooking skills and can do all kinds of different hair styles for people. What I love most about my relationship with my mom is that we share a love for reading and that makes it fun to not only read the same books with her, but to also have very in-depth conversations about them.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
              <h5 class="card-title">Dad</h5>
              <p class="card-text">My dad works at a company called Jeld-Wen which makes windows for houses and cars. He is the most hardworking person I know as he goes to work and then after work sometimes he still ends up woring on someone else's car, our own vehicles, or doing something else. My dad can fix a good number of things and I want to become as good at that as he is someday. While I get my love of reading from my mom, I get my love of math and my looks from my dad.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
              <h5 class="card-title">Caleb</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Caleb is my older brother by about 4 years. He is probably the most athletic one in the family, but he is also really good in school. He has played Hockey before, baseball, football, basketball, and ran track. You couldn't tell by looking at him, but he is a really fast runner. Additionally, he is a very comedic person and I for one think he would make a pretty good stand-up comedian.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Me</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Then there is me. I actually love sports as well, but my real passion falls into the academic setting. Contrary to most attitudes towards school, I found it very entertaining and enjoyed every second of it. Being able to learn different things and seeing things from different perspectives is something I happen to enjoy.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Jonathan</h5>
              <p class="card-text">My younger brother Jonathan who I am probably the closest with, loves school as well, but he really likes art class the most. Unlike me and our older brother, he doesn't play sports. He did baseball for a few years, but it wasn't really his cup of tea. We tend to like a lot of the same things and will play tons of games together.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Victoria</h5>
              <p class="card-text">My sister who is the youngest in the family hasn't found the one thing that she really likes yet, but she does have an assortment of things that she likes to do. She usually plays with me and Jonathan and will make us laugh. Just like me and Jonathan, sometimes she can act crazy, but it is especially when we are playing our wrestling game where we have different people and we give them different personalities. </p>
