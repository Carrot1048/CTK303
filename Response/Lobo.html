          “Hoooooowl!” The sound was getting closer as I ran through the forest. I had seen these woods before and they were very pretty, especially at night, but I wasn’t sightseeing this time. As I ran, my only thought was,<span class="italic"> ‘I have to get away; I have to get away.’</span> I ended up so lost in my thoughts that by the time I saw the slope, it was too late. I tumbled down, hitting tree after tree, rock after rock. It felt like being beat with a bat. After what seemed like an hour, but was probably only a couple of minutes, I came to a halt. My body hurt like the dickens and I just laid there, but then I remembered why I was running. I got up slowly and painfully, about to start running again, but it was too late. It was here.

          I looked into the deep yellow eyes of what would be my killer. I saw its long claws digging into the wet earth, its fangs dripping with the flesh of its last kill, and I had never felt so afraid. At the same time though, I felt this pride that I was actually looking at it, the biggest wolf known-well unknown-to humankind. Before I could revel in that accomplishment for long, it lunged and…

            I woke up with a start; boy did I hate that dream. I’ve been having it for the past few weeks and every time it happened, I would wake up in a cold sweat. I looked at my clock and saw that it was 4:30. No sense in going back to sleep. I probably couldn’t anyway so I got up to go take a shower. The warm water pounding my face and body helped calm my nerves and then since it was still early, school not starting for another 2 hours, I decided to go make my family breakfast.

            When I say family, I really mean my mom and my younger brother. I‘m fifteen and am a freshman at Lakeview High School; the same school I attend with my brother who, even though he is only thirteen, is in the same grade as me. I know what you’re thinking; you’re thinking, <span class="italic">‘wow, your brother is in the same grade as you and he’s younger, that must feel bad!’</span> Whelp! You’re wrong. It is actually kind of fun, we always get to hang out now and I can help him to get to know people. Our dad died when I was ten, my brother being eight, and after that, we got closer, but he would never talk to anyone else. I also closed myself off from other people, but after a while, I started to open back up. It was mostly because of my mom who’s been raising us by herself ever since; and boy do we know that we can drive her crazy. With the jobs she works and me and my brother being in sports, we keep her busy.

            How rude of me, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Jake and like I already said; I’m 15 and am attending Lakeview High School. I think you can guess why people named it that. My brother Alexander, we call him “Lex”; my mom, her name’s Barbara, and I all live in a small town around Montana and Idaho. The town is small, only having a population of about 3,000, and is full of woods. Most of the time it is cloudy here, but at the same time we don’t get that much rain. I like it.
